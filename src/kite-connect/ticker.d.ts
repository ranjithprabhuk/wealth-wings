     * Auto reconnection
     * -----------------
     * Auto reonnection is enabled by default and it can be disabled by passing `reconnect` param while initialising `KiteTicker`.
     *
     * Auto reonnection mechanism is based on [Exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) algorithm in which
     * next retry interval will be increased exponentially. `max_delay` and `max_tries` params can be used to tweak
     * the alogrithm where `max_delay` is the maximum delay after which subsequent reconnection interval will become constant and
     * `max_tries` is maximum number of retries before it quits reconnection.
     * For example if `max_delay` is 60 seconds and `max_tries` is 50 then the first reconnection interval starts from
     * minimum interval which is 2 seconds and keep increasing up to 60 seconds after which it becomes constant and when reconnection attempt
     * is reached upto 50 then it stops reconnecting.
     * Callback `reconnect` will be called with current reconnect attempt and next reconnect interval and
     * `on_noreconnect` is called when reconnection attempts reaches max retries.
     *
     * Here is an example demonstrating auto reconnection.
     *
     * 	import { KiteTicker } from "kiteconnect";
     * 	const ticker = new KiteTicker({
     * 		api_key: "api_key",
     * 		access_token: "access_token"
     *	});
     *
     * 	// set autoreconnect with 10 maximum reconnections and 5 second interval
     * 	ticker.autoReconnect(true, 10, 5)
     * 	ticker.connect();
     * 	ticker.on("ticks", onTicks);
     * 	ticker.on("connect", subscribe);
     *
     * 	ticker.on("noreconnect", function() {
     * 		console.log("noreconnect");
     * 	});
     *
     * 	ticker.on("reconnect", function(reconnect_count, reconnect_interval) {
     * 		console.log("Reconnecting: attempt - ", reconnect_count, " interval - ", reconnect_interval);
     * 	});
     *
     *  ticker.on("message", function(binary_msg){
     *		console.log("Binary message", binary_msg);
     *  });
     *
     * 	function onTicks(ticks) {
     * 		console.log("Ticks", ticks);
     * 	}
     *
     * 	function subscribe() {
     * 		const items = [738561];
     * 		ticker.subscribe(items);
     * 		ticker.setMode(ticker.modeFull, items);
     * 	}
